# Welcome to My GitHub Profile

Hello, and welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is Danlin, and I recently graduated from a software engineering bootcamp. I'm excited to learn more about software development and create innovative projects that solve real-world problems.

## About Me

I'm a software engineering bootcamp student with a passion for machine learning and algorithms. I'm fascinated by the potential of machine learning to solve complex problems and make more accurate predictions using data. I'm also interested in algorithms and data structures, as I believe they are essential for building efficient and scalable software systems.

I'm committed to staying up-to-date with the latest technologies and best practices in software engineering, and I'm eager to work on challenging projects and collaborate with other developers to create innovative solutions that make a positive impact on the world.

## My Projects

Here are some of the repositories in my GitHub account:



- NLP: https://github.com/danlinW527/Hyperion

  : This repository contains a Python project called watch_next, which recommends movies based on their similarity to a given movie description. The project uses the spacy library to perform advanced natural language processing and generate a list of movies with descriptions that are most similar to the input.


- Hyperion Capstone 4 OOP: https://github.com/danlinW527/Hyperion-Capstone-4-OOP

  : A python project to track shoe inventory. It allows you to manage information about shoes such as their country of origin, product code, product name, cost, and quantity.
  
 - Hyperion Capstone 3 List Functions and String Handling: https://github.com/danlinW527/Hyperion-Capstone-3-Lists-Functions-and-String-Handling

  : A python project to manage tasks. It allows you to manage information about users, tasks, generate reports and display statistics

- Other tasks: You can find my other projects via Repositories: https://github.com/danlinW527?tab=repositories

You can view the source code for these projects and more on my GitHub profile. I welcome your feedback and contributions.

## How to Get in Touch

If you'd like to chat with me about my projects or share your thoughts on software engineering, feel free to send me a message here on GitHub. I'm always looking for opportunities to connect with fellow developers and learn more about the industry.

Thank you for stopping by my profile, and I hope to hear from you soon!
